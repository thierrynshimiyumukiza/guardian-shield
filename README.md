# GuardianShield üöÄ

**Intelligent AI-Powered Web Proxy for Real-Time Threat Defense**

---

Hey everyone, I'm **Thierry Mukiza**, a passionate dev from Rwanda diving deep into AI and cybersecurity. Welcome to **GuardianShield**‚Äîmy entry for the Infinity Code Hackathon! This project is my way of tackling the relentless wave of web threats‚Äîthink SQL injections and XSS attacks that can cripple apps overnight. Inspired by the *Cyber Shield Mission* track, GuardianShield is an intelligent proxy using machine learning and OWASP rules to block malicious requests in real-time, letting safe traffic fly through.

> It‚Äôs not just code‚Äîit‚Äôs a shield for the digital world, and I‚Äôm stoked to share it with you.

## üö® The Problem We're Solving

Web apps are under siege. According to the 2025 Verizon DBIR, **over 80% of breaches** start with injection attacks or broken access controls (classic OWASP Top 10 stuff) costing businesses billions. Startups and small teams often can‚Äôt afford fancy WAFs, leaving them exposed. As a dev who‚Äôs seen friends‚Äô projects get hacked, I wanted to build something **accessible, smart, and effective**.

**GuardianShield** steps in as a lightweight proxy: analyze, detect, block. No more ‚Äúoops, the site‚Äôs down‚Äù moments.

## üõ°Ô∏è Our Solution: GuardianShield

GuardianShield is a FastAPI-based proxy that sits between your app and the internet, **scanning incoming requests for threats**. Here‚Äôs the magic:

- **Hybrid Detection:** Combines OWASP-inspired regex rules for instant blocks (e.g., `<script>` tags) with an XGBoost ML model trained on 107K+ records for nuanced scoring (**85% test accuracy!**).
- **Smart Features:** Whitelists benign requests (e.g., `search=OpenAI`), uses Hugging Face LLM for semantic analysis, and logs everything for audits.
- **Easy to Deploy:** Runs on any Python setup‚Äîno Docker needed. Train once, protect forever.

---

## ‚ú® Key Highlights

- **ML Model:** Trained on OWASP features like URL length, entropy, and injection patterns. **Threshold:** 0.7 for high precision.
- **Rules Engine:** Catches critical patterns (SQLi, XSS, command injection) with **100% accuracy** on samples.
- **Logging & Alerts:** JSON logs for blocked/allowed requests; optional email notifications.
- **Demo Results:** Blocks XSS with `critical_xss_pattern_<script` and SQLi with 0.98 probability‚Äîcheck the tests below!

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Backend:** [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) for the proxy server.
- **ML:** [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/) for classification, [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) for calibration/feature selection.
- **LLM:** Hugging Face‚Äôs [toxic-bert](https://huggingface.co/unitary/toxic-bert) for threat scoring.
- **Logging:** Built-in Python logging to files.
- **Deployment:** Render/Heroku for cloud, or local with uvicorn.

## ‚ö° Setup Instructions

Getting GuardianShield up and running is a breeze‚Äî**takes 5 minutes!**

1. **Clone the Repo:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thierrynshimiyumukiza/guardian-shield.git
    cd guardian-shield/app
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Train the Model:**
    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```
    - Uses `../datasets/MASTER_training_dataset.csv` (add your dataset here).
    - Outputs: Model files in `models/` (e.g., 86% validation accuracy).

4. **Run the Server:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
    ```

5. **Test It:**
    - **Safe request:**
        ```bash
        curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/analyze -d "search=OpenAI"
        ```
        **Response:** `{"final_verdict": "ALLOWED"}`

    - **Malicious XSS:**
        ```bash
        curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/analyze -d "<script>alert(1)</script>"
        ```
        **Response:** 
        ```json
        {
          "error": "Request blocked by AI agent",
          "reason": "critical_xss_pattern_<script",
          "mitigation": "..."
        }
        ```

    - **Logs:** Check `logs/debug_requests.log`.

6. **Deploy (Optional):**
    - Push to GitHub, connect to Render/Heroku for a live URL.

> **Note:** Update `.env` for API key/SMTP (optional for local testing).
